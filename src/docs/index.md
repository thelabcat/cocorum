Special thanks to GlobalGamer2015 for information on the SSE chat API, and to K4nji for help with the password hashing algorithm. Both helped with other API endpoints as well. Honorable mention to [a3r0id's RumblePy](https://github.com/a3r0id/RumblePy), a discontinued module that held the basis for logging in which I used.

I, Wilbur Jaywright, and my brand, Marswide BGL, have no official association with Rumble Corp. beyond that of a normal user and/or channel on the Rumble Video platform. This wrapper is not officially endorsed by Rumble Corp. or its subsidiaries.
