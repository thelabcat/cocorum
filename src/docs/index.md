Special thanks to GlobalGamer2015 for information on the SSE chat API, and to K4nji for help with the password hashing algorithm. Both helped with other API endpoints as well. Honorable mention to [a3r0id's RumblePy](https://github.com/a3r0id/RumblePy), a discontinued module that held the basis for logging in which I used.
